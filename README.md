London-Swift-Demo
=================

Demo code as shown at Swift London Meetup Wednesday 6th August 2014 at Thoughtworks

This includes the Fibonachi Playground demonstration as a Playground and the code I intended to demonstrate to show UIDynamics has been put into the ViewController of the app and can be run in the simulator.

Let me know if you have any feedback about the code, the demo/talk or anything else. I'm happy to answer quick questions but I'm also available for iOS coaching (Swift or Obj-C) or contracting.
